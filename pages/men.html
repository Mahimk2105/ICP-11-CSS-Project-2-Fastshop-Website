            First released in 2003, the Air Zoom Spiridon Cage 2 is as relevant today as ever. This edition retains the original design lines and signature caged Air Zoom unit wrapped in a glossy finish. A full-length, arched foam midsole delivers a cushioned ride, while the ultra-breezy upper balances mesh textiles with smooth synthetic leather. Meanwhile, durable traction pods on the outsole provide grip and stability. Step into the Cage 2 for a nod to early noughties style.
